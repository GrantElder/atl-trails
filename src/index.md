title: Urban Exploring & Walking
---

## Purpose

This is an individual platform for walking, exploring Atlanta, and journalling. Walking and journalling support work-life balance and mental well-being. Research shows that walking—especially in nature—reduces depressive and anxiety symptoms and improves mood and stress resilience.<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> Journaling has been shown to improve mental distress and well-being, particularly for those managing elevated anxiety.<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>

## Vision

- **Promote** — Being outdoors, multiuse trails, urban exploring, Atlanta neighborhoods
- **Publish everywhere** — GitHub and this website are the source of truth
- **Individual platform** — Not designed to work with other people's ideas; personal exploration and documentation
- **Keep people updated** — A following is okay, but that is not the whole purpose

## Values

- **Minimalism** — Simple tools, low friction
- **AI as a tool** — Use AI to organize thoughts, plans, and tools; not to replace the walking or the writing
- **Plain data formats** — Markdown, GPX, JSON; protocols and formats that last
- **Open source tools** — Prefer tools that are transparent and community-maintained
