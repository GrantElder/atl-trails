## March Walking Plans

### Atlanta Marathon Weekend — Volunteer + 26.2 Miles

**March 1–2, 2025** — [Publix Atlanta Marathon Weekend](https://www.atlantatrackclub.org/2025-publix-atlanta-marathon-weekend)

Volunteering at the Atlanta Marathon this weekend. Goal: track **26.2 miles in 24 hours**—whether from volunteering (course monitoring, finish line, etc.), walking the course, or combining volunteer shifts with exploration.

Volunteer roles include pre-race number pick-up, course monitoring, and handing out food/fluids at the finish. Some positions allow volunteers to participate in the event. [Atlanta Track Club — Get Involved](https://www.atlantatrackclub.org/get-involved)
